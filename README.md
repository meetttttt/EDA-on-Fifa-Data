# EDA-on-Fifa-Data
Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations. Here we are using FIFA dataset to perform EDA 
It is a good practice to understand the data first and try to gather as many insights from it. EDA is all about making sense of data in hand,before getting them dirty with it.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to:
1. Maximize insight into a data set;
2. Uncover underlying structure;
3. Extract important variables;
4. Detect outliers and anomalies;
5. Test underlying assumptions;
6. Develop parsimonious models; and¶
7. Determine optimal factor settings

 Conclusion:
  The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions. It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect   outliers or anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables

 Final Conclusion on EDA on Fifa data:
 Here we have done EDA on fifa Players data
 As Data was preprocessed we didnt do preprocessing of data
 We took various attribute such as weight, height and many more of the player and did EDA
 As This dataset is huge and has 104 attribute here I have done EDA on some attribute only
 Here I have only used Matplotlib only there many other library to use.
 As Data is already preprocessed but it has some missing value(simply avoid it since we are just doing EDA)
 Here I took club and compared their players respectively (You can take more Clubs)
 We also displayed from where most players comed (nationality)
 We also comapared PLayers Wages in Euro
 We also compared GoalKeepers Skills
 We also comapred Players Physic
Thats it for EDA
